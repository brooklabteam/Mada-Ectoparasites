Climate and vegetation greenness data was downloaded from NASA Earthdata using the Giovanni tool (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/). Raw climate data includes monthly time averaged maps of precipitation (TRMM: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, 0.25 degress lat/lon), temperature (TO COME), and humidity (TO COME) and raw vegatation data includes monthly time averaged maps of NDVI (MODIS-TERRA, 0.5 degrees lat/lon).
