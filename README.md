# Mada-Ectoparasites

#A Github repository for Angelo's ectoparasite work for the Coding for Conservation project. 

#Enclosed thus far:
#   Ectoparasite data
#   Code investigating the seasonal drivers of Cyclopodia dubia.

#   Climate data for ectoparasite collection sites
Climate and vegetation greenness data was downloaded from NASA Earthdata using the Giovanni tool (https://giovanni.gsfc.nasa.gov/giovanni/). Raw climate data includes monthly time averaged maps of precipitation (TRMM: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission: Near-Real-Time Precipitation Rate (TRMM_3B42RT v7, 3-Hourly, 0.25 degrees lat/lon), temperature (MERRA-2 MODEL: Surface Air Temperature (M2TMNXFLX V5.12.4, Monthly, 0.5x0.625 degrees lat/lon), and daytime humidity (AIRS: Relative Humdidity at Surface (Daytime/Ascending), AIRS-only, AIRX3STM v7.0, Monthly, 1 degree lat/lon), nighttime humidity (AIRS: Relative Humdidity at Surface (Nighttime/Descending), AIRS-only, AIRX3STM v7.0, Monthly, 1 degree lat/lon) and raw vegatation data includes monthly time averaged maps of NDVI (MODIS-TERRA, MOD13C2 v006, Monthly, 0.5 degrees lat/lon).
